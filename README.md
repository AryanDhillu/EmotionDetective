# EmotionDetective

EmotionDetective is a web application that uses machine learning to detect emotions from text input. This project is built using React for the front end and Flask for the back end.

## Features

- **Input Text:** Users can enter text expressions into the input field.
- **Emotion Detection:** EmotionDetective processes the input using a pre-trained machine learning model to detect emotions such as joy, sadness, love, anger, fear, or surprise.
- **Real-time Results:** The detected emotion is displayed in real-time on the user interface.
- **User Interaction:** Users can interact with the application through a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- **Flask:** Back-end framework for serving the machine learning model and handling requests.
- **Python (scikit-learn, nltk):** Used for natural language processing and machine learning tasks.

## Installation

1. **open the file in code editor**
2. **In a terminal cd into backend/flaskserver and execute the below command to start the backend flask server**.

   ```bash
         python server.py


3. **In another terminal cd into fronend folder and run the below commad to start frontend server i.e., React server.**

    ```bash
         npm start
